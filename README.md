# Blog-page 📝

This repo contains the development files of one of my first React projects. This page is supposed to be a blog where people can post on (without having to be registered or logged in).

The app uses a database where names and posts are stored and are retrieved on page load. You can add a new post, then edit or delete it.

## What I used 🔨
My main focus was to work with React but this project also involved using HTML & SASS.

## Extra practice ✔
I also took this opportunity to practice SASS and to learn how to use the JSON server npm package to simulate a server and use my post data base.

## Responsiveness ❕
This page is fully responsive on all screens 🙂
